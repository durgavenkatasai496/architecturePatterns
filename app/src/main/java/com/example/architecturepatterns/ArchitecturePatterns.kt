difference between MVC,MVP,MVI,MVVM :


Android architectures :

1.MVC(Model-view-controller)
2.MVP(Model-View-presenter)
3.MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel)
4.MVI (Model-View-Intent).


1.MVC :

MVC is oldest pattern.
Structure:
Model: Handles data and business logic.


View: Displays UI elements (e.g., Activity, Fragment).


Controller: Controls interactions between Model and View (often the Activity or Fragment in Android).
2.MVP :
Structure:
Model: Handles data (same as MVC).


View: Displays UI elements but does not handle logic (Activity, Fragment, View).


Presenter: Acts as a middleman between Model and View.

3.MVVM :
(Model-View-ViewModel) - Recommended for Modern Android.
ðŸ›  Google-recommended architecture for Android (Used with Jetpack ViewModel, LiveData, Flow)
Structure:
Model: Handles data.


View: UI (Activity, Fragment).


ViewModel: Stores and manages UI-related data. Survives configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation).


ðŸ“Œ Improvement:
Uses LiveData or StateFlow to automatically update the View when data changes.


4.MVI (Model-View-Intent) :

Model: Data source.


View: UI.


Intent: User actions.


State: A single source of truth for UI state.
